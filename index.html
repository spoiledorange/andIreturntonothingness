        <p>Happiness has been a mystery to me since I was a kid.</p>
        <p>I thought it is something I would be able to find when I grow up.</p>
        <p>I concluded, after lengthy contemplation, that it is not wise to search for happiness.</p>
        <p>I am just a tiny nothing lost in a colossal nothingness.</p>
        <p>Trying to find a trick or a hidden code, I read thousands of books, studies, and essay.        </p>
        <p>In books, however, I found knowledge.</p>
        <p>I learned how interesting the experience of living is.</p>
        <p>I came to know how enjoyable the journey of life could be.</p>
        <p>It did not take me long, though, to realize how sad it is to realize that!
            How pathetic it is; to be involved in a game, to understand the rules of the game, - to master the game, But innately incapable of playing.</p>
        <p>There is something not working,</p>
        <p>There is a rusty switch not clicking, </p>
        <p>There is a sensor failure somewhere, </p>
        <p>Or all of the above.</p>
        <p>What the hell have I done to myself?   .</p>
        <p>I have imprisoned myself within a self-made cell, continually deluding myself that I will one day find the key to freedom. I must admit, I was in love with Danny and cherished the moments spent with him, even though my life was miserable. I had hoped that we would eventually meet, listen to music together, and if I was fortunate, share a kiss. However, I ended the relationship by my own actions, causing him to lose trust in me. It was a miserable feeling, especially when I last spoke to him and he revealed that he had fallen in love with someone else.  I became terrified. Genuinely terrified. That was tough to swallow. All these time I was not the right person, when he spent more time with me he realized how fucked up I am, he sensed the deep weakness inside me, the shivering creature that lurking deep inside, the creature who fear everything including himself. So he decided to distance himself.. </p>
        <p>Most people I have encountered, including Danny, have agreed that I suffer from a mental illness, but I have always denied this. I thought to myself, "I am just like everyone else, right?" However, they responded with a clear "No, you are not."        </p>
        <p>The truth is, I am a living copy of the DSM. I have three personality disorders, one of which is severe. In addition, I have a few irrational phobias such as the fear of abandonment, and I also struggle with severe bipolar disorder. I also have some anxiety disorders that contribute to my character, which is named (  ) , and cooperates with a few other "fine fellows."</p>
        <p>I am; The deaf-musician,<p> <li> 
        <p> The mute-talkative.</p> <li> 
        <p>The blind-painter,</p> <li> 
        <p>The paralyzed-artist.</p> <li> 
        <p>I am here and there. </p> <li> 
        <p> And I am nowhere.</p> <li> 
        <p> And I am nobody. </p> <li> 
        <p>Not even me.</p> <li> 
        <p>For there is no me.</p> <li> 
        <p>There has never been me.</p>
        <p>Yet, I tried everything I could think of to enjoy the ride            .</p>
        <p> I shamefully failed.        </p>
        <p>I have severe mental illnesses. </p>
        <p>My brain is incapable of perceiving happiness. </p>
        <p>blind person only harms themselves should they run in the streets searching for a light.</p>
        <p>you do not live to be happy, young man. You either live happily or not.</p>
        <p>Your happiness exists, or not, within your skull, its all up there.        </p>
        <p>The chain of events does not even give me any chance to recover between them.        </p>
        <p>The crash is inevitable</p>
        <p>I am sad that I will never have the chance to meet Dany.        </p>
        <p>I am sad that I couldn't help myself.        </p>
        <p>I am sad that I failed in every relationship.</p>
        <p>I am sad that I can't find a way out like a rat trapped in a maze.</p>
        <p>I am sad that weakness is embodied deep inside me.</p>
        <p>I am not sad.. No I am disappointed.        </p>
        <p>Assert that suicide is a sign of weakness.</p>
        <p>The very first thing I felt when my consciousness emerged into existence was choking.</p>
        <p>Life chokes free spirits.</p>
        <p>I became a slave by being existed.</p>
        <p>Existence is slavery.</p>
        <p>As I reflect on my life, I realize that I am unable to express myself fully. I am filled with self-hatred, low self-esteem, and a lack of self-awareness. In contrast, when I see individuals like Danny, who love themselves, respect they're worth, and carry themselves with confidence, I feel a sense of envy. At times, I wish I could remain ignorant and not see the stark contrast between my state of being and theirs..</p>
        <p>What makes me even more depressed is the realization that there are people like Danny, who have the privilege of living with someone they love, having sex in the bed, engaging in enjoyable conversations, and even showering together. Meanwhile, I am either stuck with the wrong person or left in the darkness and coldness of loneliness. It's a cruel world that can leave someone feeling so isolated and disconnected from the warmth of human connection.        </p>
        <p>If you think you are free, then you have to redefine the word free.</p>
        <p>You are also fooled by the myth of free will.        </p>
        <p>There is no free will, my friend.</p>
        <p>You are no more than a biological robot.        </p>
        <p>What is pathetic is that you are programmed to feel the exact opposite.</p>
        <p>It is science talking here.            </p>
        <p>You are free in solely one thing, that is NOTHING! - I mean it literally.        </p>
        <p>Recently, I have found myself listening to Lorna Shore constantly. It happens to be his favorite band, and I have been playing all of their albums on repeat.        </p>
        <p>I indeed do have two people live permanently inside my skull.        </p>
        <p>They were born with me</p>
        <p>Sometimes, they have others for company. - They are all me, legally.        </p>
        <p>But I swear I am non.        </p>
        <p>I am a mere spectator.</p>
